#  Customer Behavior Analysis

## Introduction
### Problem Statement
The goal of this project is to build models that can extract customer behavior and trends from data to improve the marketing strategies of retailers and help grow their business.

### Description of Data
The E-Commerce site X provided real sales data transaction-wise, including the time of purchase, total quantity purchased, and unit price. The data set also contains customer demographics (age, gender, annual income) and product details (product ID, customer ratings).

## Project Scope
The project focuses on studying customer behavior and gaining insights into the data. Visualizing the data can provide more information, and this can be done on each individual variable in the data and the target variable. Recommender models like ALS and Content-Based Filtering can be built to make appropriate recommendations to customers to boost sales, and clustering algorithms like K-means can be used to study customers.

## Solution Approach
The CRISP-DM (Cross Industry Standard Process for Data Mining) methodology is followed to approach the business problem using the following steps:

1. Business Understanding: Understand the business problem from a business perspective.
2. Data Understanding: Collect data and perform descriptive and exploratory data analysis using univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis to discover initial insights into the data.
3. Data Preparation: Perform various activities to construct the final dataset from the raw dataset. The final dataset is used for modeling. This step includes data cleaning and data transformation.
4. Modeling: Select and apply various modeling techniques. The model that best explains and matches the domain information and also provides a good opportunity to grow sales is to be found.
5. Evaluation: Thoroughly evaluate the model using statistical techniques and ensure the business objective is met.
6. Deployment: Generate insights and recommendations from the data and model that can be presented to the business.

### Recommender System
One of the key techniques used in this project is building a recommender system. This technique helps in making personalized recommendations to customers, leading to better engagement and sales growth.

### Advanced Marketing Techniques
Apart from using recommender system techniques, other advanced marketing techniques can be used to improve business growth. For example, techniques like customer segmentation, A/B testing, and cohort analysis can help in understanding customer behavior and targeting them with personalized campaigns.
